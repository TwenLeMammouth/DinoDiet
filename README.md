# DinoDiet

DinoDiet is a endless runner 2D game made for kids with Phaser.

You control a dinosaur who needs to run while avoiding rocks and eat food appropriate to his Diet.

(Green dinosaur eats fruits and vegetables, Red dinosaur eats meat and fish).

You will need a server to run this game. I was using a Wamp server.
